*Buckling Analysis of Frames:
	Software to be used sap2000
	Assigned Frame(2 storey, 2 bays)
	Length of each bay = 5 m 
	Height of each storey = 3 meters 

*Develop a GUI for beam columns with different loads and corresponding amplification factors and  include an option to compare with beam columns without axial loads
Develop a program for carrying out the stability analysis of the beam columns . For the following support conditions :
	Simply supported Beam-column
	Fixed Ended Beam-column
		Uniform load case 
		Concentrated load case 
*Build a gui for users   where stability functions are plotted based on the given input conditions.
Technology to be used python
